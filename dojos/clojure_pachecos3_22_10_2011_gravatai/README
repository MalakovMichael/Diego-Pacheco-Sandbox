Problem: 

Loan System - Based on some user data you must provide the max amount of money that a person
can get, you also need provide the total o tax that people need pay(iof). If the user has a MAC or
is under 21 he cannot got the money. By default we do 80% of the user salary + 500 is married
+1000 if the age is over 25. The TAX(iof) is 18% of the loan for each part of the payment(multiply for number
of payments invoice).
